# AtlantisGBC
A collection of homebrew utilities for GB/GBC homebrewers.

There are a lot of utilities spread across the web that enable individuals to write and modify games for the gameboy and gameboy color platforms. However, these utilities can be hard to find and include fees to allow access to sophisticated features. The goal of this project is to provide one entire package featuring all of the essential tools to enable gb/gbc enthusiasts to create, modify, debug, emulate and perform a mryiad of other miscellaneous transformations to gb and gbc programs.these utilities will run on any system capable of running the Java runtime. The code will require no additional 3rd-party extensions or libraries other than the native libraries already packed and supported by your specific architecture's jdk/jre.
